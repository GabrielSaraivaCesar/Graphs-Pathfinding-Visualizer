# Graphs-Pathfinding-Visualizer
This repository was made for study purposes. Feel free to test it, make suggestions, create PRs or even use it for study as well üòÅ

## Features
### Interactive Canvas
The software draws the graphs in a HTML5 canvas, you can play with it by zooming in and out or dragging the content in the X and Y axis for a better visualization

### Dynamic Graphs Generation
For building the graphs I used the concept of the wave collapse function algorithm. The input for it is the size of the matrix that will be generated. So for a 2x2 matrix, the algorithm will generate up to 4 vertices

### Visualizable Algorithms
#### Chinese Postman Problem
The objective to solve this problem is finding the best path passing through all the edges and come back to the start vertex. 
To solve it I first transform the graph into an eulerian graph, this is because in most cases you'll have to pass twice through some edges to get back to
the start vertex.<br>
To make this transformation I had to first look for the odd degreed vertices, and then find the best combination of artificial paths with a combination analysis
technique.

#### Shortest Path
This algorithm was implemented using dijkstra algorithm to find the best pathing options, after running dijkstra you can simply run backwards starting from
the destination vertex and getting the best path until the start vertex.

#### Travelling Salesman Problem
TODO

#### Bridges Detector
The bridge detector works by iterating through all the edges, running a DFS algorithm starting from any of its vertices, then removing the edge from the graph and running the DFS algorithm again.
If the outputs of the 2 DFS are different, the current edge is a bridge
